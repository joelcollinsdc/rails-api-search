Going to rewrite the requirements so in case I misinterpreted something at least I'll have it documented...

Use Cases:

Should be able to browse to a form for a keyword search of an API
Form contains sidebar of recent searches, alongside with a count of the number of times the particular search has been run. 

On a search page, the results of the API search is displayed alongside with a history of when this particular search was run
