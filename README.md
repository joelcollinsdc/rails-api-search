# Sample Rails API Search

## Search form & listing page

* Form for performing a keywords search of an API
* View recent searches and count for each term in a sidebar
* Sort recent searches sidebar by keyword, count, and date

## Search results page

* Displays results of keyword search
* Shows history of when search was executed

# Assumptions

* On recent searches sidebar, "date" refers to initial creation date of search term (first time a search was run)
* Only successful API searches should be recorded

# TODO

* add paging for search terms, possibly look at re-doing the sorting to use scopes
